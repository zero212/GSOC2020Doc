# Contribute to the community

There are several paper about response time analysis but not many open source code that developer can use as reference or implementation can be found in the internet.
This project is my contribution to the open source community in this matter. 
In this project, you can find method to calculate response time in different preemptive environment: non-preemptive, cooperative, or a mixed of the above.

The class `NPandPRta` can be used and modify as developer desire, I left lots of comments inside the code itself for whoever going to ultilize that for him/herself.
Also for whoever want to approach level-i but don't have much knowledge about mathematics, `NPandPRtaNumerical` is the class you should dig in. 
It consist of the same mechanism/algorithm with `NPandPRta` but input value isn't derived from the model but from an array.
Drag down to whatever function you want to use to edit that input value, or leave as it is. 
Whatever help you understand the data flow and the equation :D.

Happy coding, don't push yourself too harsh fellow developers.
